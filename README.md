# python_quasi_overloading
playing with ways of achieving overloaded class construction type stuff

colection (3) at the moment of ways of achieving in python what other languiages do by overloading a constructor

* use classmethods to provide non-default init
* pick off keyword arguments
* specify what you want and take a function and args that provide it (why wouldn't the caller do extra step themsleves?)

not all of these are sensible

none of the classes is production quality
